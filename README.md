# Visualizing-Earthquake-Data

The purpose of this repo is to create insightful data visualizations from earthquakes around the world. This will be done by utilizing the latest Geo JSON Data from the us geological survey website . I retrieved the data using Java script d3 and leaflet libs and plot data on a map box app though an API request. The map will show magnitude and location and diameter should reflect size of earthquake - with a legend providing context of color on the  map. Lastly I displayed Tectonic plates to show relationship between fault lines and earthquake activity.
